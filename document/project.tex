   \section{The Database Problem Area}
   %make subsections as you see fit
   In today's world the most common database implementation makes use of the relational model. However, due to the increase in the amount of data collected today and considering the fact that the data is often unstructured an alternative database implementation must be considered namely NoSQL. The problem is that while unstructured data is becoming more prominent there is still a need for modest-sized databases that holds structured data. This prompts the question on whether or not NoSQL databases will replace relational databases. As there is a general move towards NoSQL databases and the increasing availability of open-source NoSQL databases it encourages the database designer to question whether he should make use of a NoSQL database. Any good database designer will not just follow the crowd but fully investigate the performance of the database. It is well known that NoSQL databases perform very well for large, unstructured collections of data but this begs the question how will a relational database fair against a NoSQL database for a modest-sized database that holds structured data and this is what was researched.
